/*
  Optionally define a secure IP adress, that is allowed to make tpath queries
  See: https://thegharstation.com/gharwiki/index.php/User:Alfwyn/Sandbox#Tpath
  Currently only a limited subset is implemented, but more is planned.
  This feature mainly exists for me to debug tpath expressions and the tpath
  implementation.

  No attempt is made to sanitize the tpath string, and malicious
  expressions could be a real resource hog.

  127.0.0.1 may be a good choice for the definition.
